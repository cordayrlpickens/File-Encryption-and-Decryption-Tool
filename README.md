# File Encryption and Decryption Tool | C++

Created a file encryption and decryption tool using the Caesar Cipher algorithm in C++. The tool allows users to encrypt and decrypt files by shifting the characters (or bytes) in the file using a key provided by the user. The program handles binary files, ensuring that any file type can be encrypted or decrypted without data loss. The project demonstrates file handling, basic encryption techniques, and user input handling through a simple console interface.
